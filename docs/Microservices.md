# Microservices

## Description

Microservices are a software engineering architecture based on loosely-coupled services.  It is related to SOA.

Microservices are often cited in reliability due to their ability to improve a systems ability to degrade if a service is unavailable, as well as allows for more efficient scaling when one service scales differently than others.
